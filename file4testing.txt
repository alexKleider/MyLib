# File: file4testing.txt

This is a text file used to test the indent.py script.

It should deal with one, two, or three params.

The one mandatory parameter is the name of an input file.
If the second parameter is an iteger it replaces the default
number of spaces to indent (which is INDENT=6.)
If it is not an integer, or if it is and there is a third
parameter, this specifies the name of an output file.
If no output file is specified, output goes to "new_<infile>".
